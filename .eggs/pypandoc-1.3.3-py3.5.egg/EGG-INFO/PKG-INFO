        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bebraw/pypandoc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bebraw/pypandoc)
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pypandoc.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc/)
        [![conda version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypandoc/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypandoc/)
        
        pypandoc provides a thin wrapper for [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), a universal
        document converter.
        
        ## Installation
        
        pypandoc uses `pandoc`, so it needs an available installation of `pandoc`. For some common cases
        (wheels, conda packages), pypandoc already includes `pandoc` (and `pandoc_citeproc`) in it's
        prebuilt package.
        
        If `pandoc` is already installed (`pandoc` is in the PATH), `pypandoc` uses the version with the
        higher version number and if both are the same, the already installed version. See [Specifying the location of pandoc binaries](#specifying_binaries) for more.
        
        To use `pandoc` filters, you must have the relevant filter installed on your machine.
        
        ### Installing via pip
        
        Install via `pip install pypandoc`.
        
        Prebuilt [wheels for Windows and Mac OS X](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc/) include
        pandoc. If there is no prebuilt binary available, you have to
        [install `pandoc` yourself](#installing-pandoc-manually).
        
        If you use Linux and have [your own wheelhouse](http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#usage),
        you can build a wheel which include `pandoc` with
        `python setup.py download_pandoc; python setup.py bdist_wheel`. Be aware that this works only
        on 64bit intel systems, as we only download it from the
        [official source](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases).
        
        ### Installing via conda
        
        `pypandoc` is included in [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/). The conda packages will
        also install the `pandoc` package, so `pandoc` is available in the installation.
        
        Install via `conda install -c conda-forge pypandoc`.
        
        You can also add the channel to your conda config via
        `conda config --add channels conda-forge`. This makes it possible to
        use `conda install pypandoc` directly and also lets you update via `conda update pypandoc`.
        
        ### Installing pandoc
        
        If you don't get `pandoc` installed via a prebuild wheel which includes `pandoc` or via the
        conda package dependencies, you need to install `pandoc` by yourself.
        
        #### Installing pandoc via pypandoc
        
        Installing via pypandoc is possible on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux (Intel-based):
        
        ```python
        # expects a installed pypandoc: pip install pypandoc
        from pypandoc.pandoc_download import download_pandoc
        # see the documentation how to customize the installation path
        # but be aware that you then need to include it in the PATH
        download_pandoc()
        ```
        
        The default install location is included in the search path for `pandoc`, so you
        don't need to add it to `PATH`.
        
        #### Installing pandoc manually
        
        Installing manually via the system mechanism is also possible. Such installation mechanism
        make `pandoc` available on many more platforms:
        
        - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install pandoc`
        - Fedora/Red Hat: `sudo yum install pandoc`
        - Arch: `sudo pacman -S pandoc`
        - Mac OS X with Homebrew: `brew install pandoc pandoc-citeproc Caskroom/cask/mactex`
        - Machine with Haskell: `cabal-install pandoc`
        - Windows: There is an installer available
          [here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)
        - [FreeBSD port](http://www.freshports.org/textproc/pandoc/)
          - Or see http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html
        
        Be aware that not all install mechanismen put `pandoc` in `PATH`, so you either
        have to change `PATH` yourself or set the full path to `pandoc` in
        `PYPANDOC_PANDOC`. See the next section for more information.
        
        ### <a name="specifying_binaries"></a>Specifying the location of pandoc binaries
        
        You can point to a specific pandoc version by setting the environment variable
        `PYPANDOC_PANDOC` to the full path to the pandoc binary
        (`PYPANDOC_PANDOC=/home/x/whatever/pandoc` or `PYPANDOC_PANDOC=c:\pandoc\pandoc.exe`).
        If this environment variable is set, this is the only place where pandoc is searched for.
        
        In certain cases, e.g. pandoc is installed but a web server with its own user
        cannot find the binaries, it is useful to specify the location at runtime:
        
        ```python
        import os
        os.environ.setdefault('PYPANDOC_PANDOC', '/home/x/whatever/pandoc')
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are two basic ways to use `pypandoc`: with input files or with input
        strings.
        
        
        ```python
        import pypandoc
        
        # With an input file: it will infer the input format from the filename
        output = pypandoc.convert_file('somefile.md', 'rst')
        
        # ...but you can overwrite the format via the `format` argument:
        output = pypandoc.convert_file('somefile.txt', 'rst', format='md')
        
        # alternatively you could just pass some string. In this case you need to
        # define the input format:
        output = pypandoc.convert_text('#some title', 'rst', format='md')
        # output == 'some title\r\n==========\r\n\r\n'
        ```
        
        `convert_text` expects this string to be unicode or utf-8 encoded bytes. `convert_*` will always
        return a unicode string.
        
        It's also possible to directly let `pandoc` write the output to a file. This is the only way to
        convert to some output formats (e.g. odt, docx, epub, epub3, pdf). In that case `convert_*()` will
        return an empty string.
        
        ```python
        import pypandoc
        
        output = pypandoc.convert_file('somefile.md', 'docx', outputfile="somefile.docx")
        assert output == ""
        ```
        
        In addition to `format`, it is possible to pass `extra_args`.
        That makes it possible to access various `pandoc` options easily.
        
        ```python
        output = pypandoc.convert_text(
            '<h1>Primary Heading</h1>',
            'md', format='html',
            extra_args=['--atx-headers'])
        # output == '# Primary Heading\r\n'
        output = pypandoc.convert(
            '# Primary Heading',
            'html', format='md',
            extra_args=['--base-header-level=2'])
        # output == '<h2 id="primary-heading">Primary Heading</h2>\r\n'
        ```
        pypandoc now supports easy addition of
        [pandoc filters](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html).
        
        ```python
        filters = ['pandoc-citeproc']
        pdoc_args = ['--mathjax',
                     '--smart']
        output = pd.convert_file(source=filename,
                                 to='html5',
                                 format='md',
                                 extra_args=pdoc_args,
                                 filters=filters)
        ```
        Please pass any filters in as a list and not as a string.
        
        Please refer to `pandoc -h` and the
        [official documentation](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html) for further details.
        
        > Note: the old way of using `convert(input, output)` is deprecated as in some cases it wasn't
        possible to determine whether the input should be used as a filename or as text.
        
        ## Dealing with Formatting Arguments
        
        Pandoc supports custom formatting though `-V` parameter. In order to use it through
        pypandoc, use code such as this:
        
        ```python
        output = pypandoc.convert_file('demo.md', 'pdf', outputfile='demo.pdf',
          extra_args=['-V', 'geometry:margin=1.5cm'])
        ```
        
        > Note: it's important to separate `-V` and its argument within a list like that or else
        it won't work. This gotcha has to do with the way
        [`subprocess.Popen`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) works.
        
        ## Getting Pandoc Version
        
        As it can be useful sometimes to check what Pandoc version is available at your system or which
        particular `pandoc` binary is used by `pypandoc`. For that, `pypandoc` provides the following
        utility functions. Example:
        
        ```
        print(pypandoc.get_pandoc_version())
        print(pypandoc.get_pandoc_path())
        print(pypandoc.get_pandoc_formats())
        ```

        ## Contributing
        
        Contributions are welcome. When opening a PR, please keep the following guidelines in mind:
        
        1. Before implementing, please open an issue for discussion.
        2. Make sure you have tests for the new logic.
        3. Make sure your code passes `flake8 pypandoc/*.py tests.py`
        4. Add yourself to contributors at `README.md` unless you are already there. In that case tweak your contributions.
        
        Note that for citeproc tests to pass you'll need to have [pandoc-citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc) installed. If you installed a prebuilt wheel or conda package, it is already included.
